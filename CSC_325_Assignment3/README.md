I did not use AI for this assignment.
  
Each subclass has its own main method to run, demonstrating the creation of a shape object and its applicable methods.

Interfaces were easier to create. While they were separate files, they required minimal programming within them. The abstract classes, however, had concrete methods to program within them. Additionally, methods in interfaces were easier to work with, as there were no method bodies. If there was an error in the code, it was likely in the method in the subclass, not the method in the interface. I believe that in this situation, interfaces would scale better. If different subclasses were introduced that used different properties, the concrete methods in the abstract class wouldn't work. Since interfaces don't have concrete methods, they would scale better in that situation. For this situation with just the three subclasses that used the same properties, the abstract class worked better. Methods that did not need to change between shapes could be made concrete in the abstract class, which simplified the process. In a large-scale project where shapes would inevitably have different properties, interfaces would work best. Polymorphism changed the way I approached these classes by optimizing certain processes. As abstract classes can have concrete methods, and all the objects of the shape subclasses use the same properties, I made the constructor for the three subclasses within the abstract class, and just called upon it with the super keyword in the subclasses. Interfaces were more maintainable overall, as there were few issues that arose within the interfaces themselves. If there were issues, they were most likely in the subclasses rather than the interface. They were easier to use. Overall, I believe that abstract classes worked better for this assignment, but if the scope was expanded, interfaces would be better in the long run.
